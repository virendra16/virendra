Q2 3V's of Big Data
Volume(Data Size),Variety(Data Sources),Velocity(Speed of Change) are the 3V's of Big Data.

Q3 Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling
Horizontal scaling: In horizontal scaling We are thinking about adding more CPU cores, more Storage and more RAM to that instance to improve the query performance.
This is what we called Vertical scaling(Scaling up) , means adding more CPU power and storage resource to a single instance.All of your data is in a single machine. No need to manage multiple instance
 Advantage: All of your data is in a single machine, No need to manage multiple instance.
 Disadvantag: The problem is the cost efficiency,a powerful machine having large number of CPU and 
 higher RAM capacity is costlier than a set of small size instances.
 
 Vertical Scaling:Horizontal scaling divides the data set and distributes the data over multiple servers, or shards. 
 Each shard is an independent database, and collectively, the shards make up a single logical database.
 Advantage: All of your data is in smaller chunks so program can process them very fast with parallel job distribution among all instance.
Disadvantage:The problem is about managing those instances and the complex distributed architecture.


Q4 Need and Working of Hadoop
 As the amount of available data grows, the problem of managing the information becomes more difficult, which can lead to 
information overload. HAdoop is a slution of Data explosion.
The way HDFS works is by having a main « NameNode » and multiple « data nodes » on a commodity hardware cluster. All the nodes are usually organized within the same physical rack in the data center.
Data is then broken down into separate « blocks » that are distributed among the various data nodes for storage.
